[Purchase the game on steam here!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262620/Broombot_Battlegrounds/), this was my capstone project for DePaul University.

This was a commercially released project on steam meant to simulate a game development studio enviroment. In this project i was tasked with creating level props, Weapons, and Broombot Bodies. Production on this project went as far as going to conventions like Pax East, M+Dev and being featured on IndieCade Horizons in 2022. This project was supposed to see a port to the Nintendo Switch and a overall rebuild of the game including heavy optimization work both in the game's visuals, and performance. Despite not being in a predominantly code based role techniques involving lower level code optimizations in a practical software setting are something that i understand how to do and have applied to future projects!.
This was a team based project starting off at 11 people before slowly dropping down to 5 core team members. 1 Designer, 1 Producer, 2 Programers and 1 Artist. Despite the roles one of the programmers was also the primary 2D artist.
