Fields related to current work:
- Information Technology
  - Being a game developer means you have to know your equipment and the skills necessary to repair and maintain equipment.
  - Working in retail close to computer equipment and having that equipment fail i have had to learn how our equipment works in order to prevent it from going down and keeping the high stress high bandwith work of retail flowing.
- Game Programming
  - Being an indepenent game developer means that i have to learn hard things like how to put the game together from a designer by utilizing data structures and algorithims to organize game data in a way that is practical to game development. 
  - Such examples can be seen in Doc's Shufflin' Shootout where a majority of the game was programmed by me using tools like google and the unity asset store to fufil design needs present in said game.
- 3D Art
  - Using blender and maya 3D solid meshes were used to create props, weapons and broombot bodies. Skills such as UV unwrapping, Texturing and Sculpting from other meshes. 
  - Using techiques to lower triangle counts, optimizing texture sizes to be scalable, and finding solutions for procedurally generated textures for meshes

The following are technology related fields I am currently interested in:
- Networking
  - Dealing with how computers and devices interact and "talk" with each other.
- Virtual reality
  - Finding more immersive ways to experience games.
- Technology Education
  - Teaching people both young and old on how to utilze technology best to suit their needs as a supervisor in retail that utilizes an app to add discounts to customer's orders.
- A.I.
  - Not necessarily Generative AI but oldschool A.I like behavior trees, A* Algorithim's giving personality to enemies, like in pokemon Legends Arceus and the Half Life series
