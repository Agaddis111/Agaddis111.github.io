This project was originally made for the Indie city led Jampus, secret santa game jam, in 2024. Won 4th overall with it winning #1 in art. Created with the collaberative effort of Justin Cavazos and Annabelle Sun. This is a project that is still in active development with my contributions being largely a programming and design role creating the player's movement, shooting, and the card mechanics that make it a unique spin on a deck building shoot-em-up with a western twist.
